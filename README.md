# How Player Height Affects the NBA
### Team Members
*Lindsay Reynolds, Nick Sheets*
### Project Description
Examine the height of NBA players to determine if height impacts performance or salary  
* name
* team
* height
* points per game
* blocks per game
* rebounds per game
* assists per game
* salary
* other (for example fouls per game, birth country, rookie year)  

Analyze data looking for the impact of height on performance or salary
* height v. ppg
* height v. blocks per game
* height v. rebounds per game
* height v. assists per game
* height v. salary  

Analyze the data looking for impact of performance on salary

### Research Questions to Answer

Players:  
* What is the average height of an NBA player?
* Does height impact performance (ppg, blocks, rebounds or assists per game)?  
* Do taller players score more often?
* Do taller players make more blocks? (expecting strong correlation)
* Do taller players make more steals? (expecting strong correlation)
* Do taller players have more or less assists per game than shorter players? (negative correlation?)  
* Does height impact salary? 
* Do taller or shorter players make more money?  

Teams:
* What teams have the highest average player height and what teams have the lowest?
* Does height play a part in W/L percentage?

### Rough Breakdown of Tasks  
#### Jupyter Notebook 1: Describe the data exploration and cleanup processes
- [ ] Identify the sources to be used and gather the data
- [ ] Determine years to be used and what data to retrieve from where
- [ ] Import the data to a jupyter notebook for analysis
- [ ] Clean the data for any duplicates or other issues with pandas
- [ ] Make any updates needed for formatting
- [ ] Put the data into a dataframe
- [ ] Determine best plots to use
- [ ] Load the dataframe to csv to retrieve for notebook 2

#### Jupyter Notebook 2: Data Analysis
- [ ] Using the dataframe created, create the plots needed to help analyze the data
- [ ] Perform calcs as needed for averages
- [ ] Add linear regression models to plots and look at relationships
- [ ] correlation and p-values
- [ ] Use this info to make observations about the research questions 
 
#### Prepare a summary of observations
